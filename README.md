# Anonymous chat room inside Nostr
anonroom: a censorship-resistant, anonymous chat room inside Nostr - so resistant, the creator of the protocol can't stop it. It's plaintext-only - allowing image would lead to bad things like NSFW pictures or tracking pixels.

A short explanation of this whole thing: The chat room is a keypair. Anyone who wants to post signs event with the room's keypair. Since everyone posts under the room's pubkey, no one knows who's who.
