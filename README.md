# Anonymous chat room inside Nostr
I created anonroom because I wanted to experiment with [Nostr](https://github.com/fiatjaf/nostr). It's an interesting experiment, for sure, but I don't see any useful discussion here. Since this chat room is anonymous, people can be dicks without facing the consequences, which I have no interest in dealing with.

This lil' app (site) is retired. If you'd like to run anonroom, fork the project and go back one commit. Have a great day.
