# Anonymous chat room inside Nostr
anonroom: a censorship-resistant, anonymous chat room inside [Nostr](https://github.com/fiatjaf/nostr). It's plaintext-only - allowing image would lead to bad things like NSFW pictures or tracking pixels.

A short explanation of this whole thing: The chat room is a keypair. Anyone who wants to post signs event with the room's keypair. Since everyone posts under the room's pubkey, no one knows who's who. The room's private key is `6ba903b7888191180a0959a6d286b9d0719d33a47395c519ba107470412d2069` and its public key is `8565b1a5a63ae21689b80eadd46f6493a3ed393494bb19d0854823a757d8f35f`.
